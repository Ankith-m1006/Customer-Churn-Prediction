## Introduction

Customer churn prediction is essential for businesses to identify customers who are likely to leave (churn) and to take proactive measures to retain them. This project aims to build a predictive model to identify potential churners based on historical data.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from [Dataset Source](#). It contains customer information, usage patterns, and other relevant features that can help in predicting churn.

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-churn-prediction.git
cd customer-churn-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the raw data.
   ```bash
   python src/data_preprocessing.py
   ```

2. **Model Training:** Train the predictive model on the processed data.
   ```bash
   python src/model_training.py
   ```

3. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of the trained model.
   ```bash
   python src/model_evaluation.py
   ```

## Modeling Process

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understand the dataset, identify trends, and visualize data.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize/scale features.
3. **Model Building:** Train various machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) and select the best-performing model.
4. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC.

## Results

The final model achieves an accuracy of 93% and an ROC-AUC score of Y%. Detailed evaluation results and model performance metrics are available in the `notebooks/Modeling.ipynb` notebook.
